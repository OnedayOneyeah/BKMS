Stitches artist: Shawn Mendes lyrics: NA I thought that I've been hurt before But no one's ever left me quite this sore Your words cut deeper than a knife Now I need someone to breathe me back to life Got a feeling that I'm going under But I know that I'll make it out alive If I quit calling you my lover Move on You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking Falling onto my knees And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches Tripping over myself, aching Begging you to come help And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches Just like a moth drawn to a flame Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain Your bitter heart, cold to the touch Now I'm gonna reap what I sow I'm left seeing red on my own Got a feeling that I'm going under But I know that I'll make it out alive If I quit calling you my lover Move on You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking Falling onto my knees And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches Tripping over myself, aching Begging you to come help And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head Get you out of my head You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking Falling onto my knees And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches

get hard sometimes It is the only thing that makes us feel alive We keep this love in a photograph We made these memories for ourselves Where our eyes are never closing Our hearts were never broken And time's forever frozen, still So you can keep me Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans Holding me close until our eyes meet You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul And it's the only thing that I know, know I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya And it's the only thing to take with us when we die We keep this love in a photograph We made these memories for ourselves Where our eyes are never closing Our hearts were never broken And time's forever frozen, still So you can keep me Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans Holding me close until our eyes meet You won't ever be alone And if you hurt me, that's okay baby Only words bleed inside these pages You just hold me And I won't ever let you go Wait for me to come home Wait for me to come home Wait for me to come home Wait for me to come home Oh you can fit me Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen Next to your heartbeat where I should be Keep it deep within your soul And if you hurt me, that's okay baby Only words bleed inside these pages You just hold me And I won't ever let you go When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me Under the lamppost back on Sixth street Hearing you whisper through the phone Wait for me to come home Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes But it's the only thing that I know When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes It is the only thing that makes us feel alive We keep this love in a photograph We made these memories for ourselves Where our eyes are never closing Our hearts were

sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry 'Cause you're scared, I ain't there Daddy's with you in your prayers No more cryin', wipe them tears Daddy's here, no more nightmares We gon' pull together through it We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein' Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something We have no control over, and that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (heh) It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin' 'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom And at the time, every house that we lived in Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it And you and Lainie were too young to understand it Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sittin' in this empty house Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it? Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'ma give you the world I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'ma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!

Lights will guide you home And ignite your bones And I will try to fix you And high up above or down below When you're too in love to let it go But if you never try, you'll never know Just what you're worth Lights will guide you home And ignite your bones And I will try to fix you NA Tears stream down your face When you lose something you cannot replace Tears stream down your face And I Tears stream down your face I promise you I will learn from my mistakes Tears stream down your face And I Lights will guide you home And ignite your bones And I will try to fix you\n","track name: Impossible artist: James Arthur lyrics: Mmm-hmm, mm I remember years ago Someone told me I should take Caution when it comes to love, I did And you were strong and I was not My illusion, my mistake I was careless, I forgot, I did And now when all is done There is nothing to say You have gone and so effortlessly You have won, you can go ahead tell them Tell them all I know now Shout it from the rooftops Write it on the skyline All we had is gone now Tell them I was happy And my heart is broken All my scars are open Tell them what I hoped would be Impossible, impossible Impossible, impossible Falling out of love is hard Falling for betrayal is worse Broken trust and broken hearts I know, I know Thinking all you need is there Building faith on love and words Empty promises will wear I know, I know And now when all is done There is nothing to say And if you're done with embarrassing me On your own you can go ahead tell them Tell them all I know now Shout it from the rooftops Write it on the skyline All we had is gone now Tell them I was happy And my heart is broken All my scars are open Tell them what I hoped would be Impossible, impossible Impossible, impossible I remember years ago Someone told me I should take Caution when it comes to love, I did Tell them all I know now Shout it from the rooftops Write it on the skyline All we had is gone now Tell them I was happy And my heart is broken All my scars are open Tell them what I hoped would be Impossible (impossible), impossible (impossible) Impossible, impossible Impossible (impossible), impossible (impossible) Impossible, impossible\n"]}]}]}
